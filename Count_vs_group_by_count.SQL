-- COUNT() with GROUP BY
Use COUNT() with GROUP BY when you want to group rows by a column and perform an aggregate function (like counting) on each group. This is often used to summarize data.

Example: Count the number of people with each email address:


""SELECT email, COUNT(id) as person_count
FROM Person
GROUP BY email;
This will return a list of email addresses and the number of people associated with each email address.""


-- GROUP BY with HAVING COUNT()

Use GROUP BY with HAVING COUNT() when you want to filter groups based on an aggregate condition. The HAVING clause is similar to the WHERE clause, but it is used for aggregate functions and applies to groups of rows.

Example: Select email addresses that appear more than once in the table:


""SELECT email
FROM Person
GROUP BY email
HAVING COUNT(id) > 1;""
